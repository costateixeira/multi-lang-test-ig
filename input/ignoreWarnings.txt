# This was erroneously deprecated and will be coming back
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# This shouldn't be marked as deprecated and will be fixed in THO
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/variant-state|1.0.0

# This is an example code system, so THO rules don't apply
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# This is inherited from the core specification
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex


# This is an example and is not expected to resolve
WARNING: CapabilityStatement/example: CapabilityStatement.messaging[0].endpoint[0].address: No definition could be found for URL value 'mllp:10.1.1.10:9234'

# This is auto-injected by the tools and isn't defined in the Obligation extension
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/example: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[9].extension[0].extension[2]: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/obligation|5.2.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
